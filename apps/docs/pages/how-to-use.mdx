# How to Use

1) Connect your MetaMask wallet on Linea and enable round-ups for your MetaMask Card purchases.  
2) Approve the allowance so autoHODL can top up Aave with each spare change amount.  
3) Use your MetaMask Card as usual; round-ups are sent to Aave automatically.  
4) Track your growing balance in the autoHODL app.  

Tip: Once ERC-7715 is live on Linea, switch to delegation-based permissions for native, trustless automation.
