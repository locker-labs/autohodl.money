# Overview

- Passive savings inspired by Acorns, built for Web3.
- Each MetaMask Card purchase on Linea is rounded up; the difference is deposited into Aave to earn yield.
- Example: Spend 7.38 USDC → 0.62 USDC auto-deposited to Aave, earning immediately.
- Current automation uses token allowances; planned migration to ERC-7715 (MetaMask Delegation Toolkit) on Linea for native, trustless round-ups.
- Award-winning: MetaMask Card Hackathon + Smart Accounts Kit Hackathon (Text Swap).
