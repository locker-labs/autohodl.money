# Spendable Yield Tokens (SYTs)

SYTs are wrapped yield tokens (e.g., Aave's aUSDC) with a better spend experience:

- When you send aUSDC, the recipient receives aUSDC.  
- When you spend **sUSDC** (spendable USDC), the recipient gets regular **USDC**.  
- On autoHODL, yield is distributed as **sUSDC**, so users earn passively while keeping funds liquid and spendable at any time.

Why it matters:
- **Better UX:** Spend yield-bearing assets as normal USDC.  
- **Stay earning:** You keep earning until the moment of spend.  
- **Composability:** Works with round-ups and future integrations.
