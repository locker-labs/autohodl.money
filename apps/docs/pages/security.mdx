# Security & Custody

- **Allowances today:** Uses token allowances for seamless automation; no custody of your wallet.  
- **Planned ERC-7715:** Move to native, trustless permissions on Linea when available.  
- **Funds in your control:** Round-ups sit in Aave under your permissions; SYTs (sUSDC) stay liquid and can be spent or redeemed back to USDC.
